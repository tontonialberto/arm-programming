Description:
	Basically, an endless while loop where at each step a GPIO pin gets toggled.
	The pin signal can be used to measure how much time it takes to execute a single iteration.
	This can be useful to write naive delay functions, or to compare different compilers and/or 
	different optimization levels.

Requirements:
    -Freescale FRDM-KL25Z development board with CMSIS-DAP debug/programming app.
	-Logic Level Analyzer, if you want to analyze the signal generated by the GPIO pin.
		In this case, you will also need a software that allows you to interact with the analyzer
		(eg. I used Sigrok PulseView).
