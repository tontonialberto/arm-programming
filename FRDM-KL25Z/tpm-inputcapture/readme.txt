Description:
    Count the period of a signal generated by pressing an external switch,
	using the Input Capture mode of TPM2 peripheral (Falling edge detection).
	
Usage:
	Put a breakpoint right after the code that evaluates the difference between previous
	instant and the current one. Then, press the switch to visualize the "period" of the generated
	square wave (ie. the time passed between two falling edges).

Requirements:
    -Freescale FRDM-KL25Z development board with CMSIS-DAP debug/programming app.
    -Pushbutton Switch
	-The schematic is as follows:
		SW -> PTE4
		SW -> GND
